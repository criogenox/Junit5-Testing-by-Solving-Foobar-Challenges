<!-- ABOUT THE REPO -->
## About the repo

<div align="justify">
Solving task on my own just for the enjoyment itself. It was (and still) fun doing it.  <br /> <br />
If you came here, already know what foobar is; If not, thanks for your visit :raised_hands:. <br /> <br />

  Let's use ChatGPT shortcut for the explantion step: 
  
> **_Google's Foobar challenge is an invitation-only coding challenge that Google uses to identify and recruit talented programmers_** (being honest, they probably could offer a sort of internship if you're talent enough; not bad at all, anyway :muscle:)

> **_It typically appears as a pop-up message on a user's screen when they are searching for coding-related terms on Google_** (like a creepy surprise; I thought I was being hacked)

> **_Some people have reported receiving an invitation after searching for specific coding-related terms on Google; or have received an invitation through a referral_** (or looking for how to remove stain from carpet; whichever occurs first)

### Additional info

* If possible, done with pure plain core java; no streams preferred used (let the brain does its job).

* Added more test cases (besides those originally given), including extreme ones to avoid long execution times.

* For a more in-depth understanding of the implemented code, as many comments as possible have been included.

* Each task constructor was renamed using suffixes (ex: solution1, solution2 and so forth) to include them in a single class.

* No intention of winning the code-of-the-year championship; It can be improved what was done, be my guest.
